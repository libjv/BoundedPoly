== Abstract
`BoundedPoly<Storage, Base, Mover = ...>` is a type abstractor.
It stores any no-throw movable polymorphic derived class of `Base` that fits into size and alignment of `Storage`.
It provides semantics similar to `std::unique_ptr<Base>` and `std::variant<...>`:

- The memory is owned by the instance (like both, and unlike `std::reference_wrapper<Base>`).
- The type can change over time (like both).
- The actual type of the stored value is not known (like `unique_ptr`).
- The set of accepted types is not closed (line `unique_ptr` and unline `variant`).
- It is allocated on the stack (like `variant`).
- It cannot be empty, even when exceptions are thrown (like `variant`, but greater guarantee).

This allows to use both polymorphic-semantics and stack-allocation (and so, cache-friendlyness).

== Examples

=== Shape

.IShape
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=IShape]
----
We first create an interface named `IShape`.
It provides a `get_area()` method which returns the area of the shape.
It also provides a `move_to` method to move itself to an uninitialized storage.

.ShapeMaxSize
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=ShapeMaxSize]
----
We choose an arbitrary size to store shapes. 

.Shape
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=Shape]
----
We define `Shape` as an alias of `BoundedPolyVM<Storage, Base, Method>`, which is an alias to `BoundedPoly<Storage,Base,VirtualMover<Base, Method>>`.
VM (Virtual Mover) means that we used a virtual method in order to make move operations.

So `BoundedPoy<Storage,Base,Mover>` is instantiated with the following template parameters:

* `Storage = std::aligned_storage_t<ShapeMaxSize>` : it can only stores shapes with `sizeof(_) pass:c[<=] ShapeMaxSize`.
* `Base = IShape` : the polymorphic type abstracted
* `Mover = VirtualMover<IShape, &IShape::move_to>` : we specify that to perform a move operation on `IShape`, we must call its virtual method `move_to`.

.Circle
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=Circle]
----
We define `Circle` an implementation of `IShape` whose area is defined by _PI * radiusÂ²_.

.Rectangle
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=Rectangle]
----
We define `Rectangle` an implementation of `IShape` whose are is defined by `width * height`.

.RectangleEx
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=RectangleEx]
----
`RectangleEx` is an improvement of `Rectangle`.
But its added members make its size too big to fit in `ShapeMaxSize` bytes.
So it cannot be handled by `Shape`.

.main
[source,cpp]
----
include::{Example1}[tag=main]
----
<1> Construct-moving a `Circle` of radius 1.414 (about `sqrt(2)`).
<2> `dynamic_cast` does not throw: it is really a `Circle` that is stored.
<3> Emplacing in place a `Rectangle`. This is allowed because `Rectangle` is nothrow-constructible.
<4> `dynamic_cast` does not throw: it is really a `Rectangle` that is stored.

== Benchmark

The benchmark compares the performances of `std::variant`, `std::unique_ptr` and `jv::utils::PolyStorage`. +
The program generates a sequence of operations (Addition, Substraction and ExclusiveXor) to be applied on an `int`. +
The sequence is stored in a `std::vector` with space reserved outside of the time measurements. +
The type stored in `std::vector` is either a `std::variant`, a `std::unique_ptr` or a `jv::utils::PolyStorage`. +
The operation is applied using the _visitor pattern_ for `std::variant` and polymorphic dispatch using `unique_ptr` and `PolyStorage`.

We measure 2 things: time of constructing the sequence of operations, and time of evaluating the sequence of operations.
These results are taken after compiling `bounded-poly.cpp`, `variant.cpp` and `unique-ptr.cpp` with `g++ -std=c++17 -O2`.
Each result is taken as the minimum of three tries.
The sequence contains 100'000'000 operations.

.Benchmark results
|===
| Which | Construction timing | Evaluation timing

| `std::unique_ptr` | 3.2718 seconds | 0.2755 seconds

| `std::variant` | 1.2204 seconds | 0.1900 seconds

| `jv::utils::BoundedPoly` | 1.4158 seconds | 0.1846 seconds

|===

We see that `unique_ptr` is the worse alternative both for construction and evaluation.
This was expected, because at construction, it needs heap allocation, and at evaluation, it is not cache-friendly.

We see that `variant` and `BoundedPoly` have similar performances.

== Comparaisons

.Syntax (CAUTION: this is highly opiniated)
* I do prefer the calling syntax of polymorphism (as with `unique_ptr` and `BoundedPoly`), instead of `std::visit` and lambdas (as with `variant`).
* `unique_ptr` and `variant` have minimal bloat code in the class definition.
  For `BoundedPoly`, we needed to define a `move_to` operation for each derived class, which is indeed bloat code.
  It is not needed, by using `UniversalMover` instead of `VirtualMover`, but this adds space cost (one function pointer per BoundedPoly).

.Customization
* `unique_ptr` is the most customizable, because it can stores any type derived from `Base`.
* `variant` is the less customizable, because the types it accepts cannot be customized by a 3rd party.
* `BoundedPoly` is a good compromise, types being bounded only by their size and alignment.

.Storage
* `unique_ptr` is heap allocated, so it is slow both to allocate and to access.
* `variant` and `BoundedPoly` are stack allocated, si it is cache-friendly and does not require system calls for construction.
